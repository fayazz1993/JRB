GIT: GLOBAL INFORMATION TRACKER 
WHY: Which is Used to store and track the code.
Git is Distributed Version Control System means we can store the code on Multiple Repositories.

SCM: SOURCE CODE MANAGEMENT TOOL
VCS: VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM

ALTERS: SVN, MERCURY

YEAR: 2005
INVENTED BY: LINUS TORVALDS
PROGRAMMING: C 
TYPE: OPEN SOURCE
GENERATION: 3RD 

BEFORE GIT:
SCCM -- > RCS -- > CVS -- > SVN -- > GIT 

DVCS: STORE CODE ON MULTIPLE REPOS
EX: GIT
CVCS: STORE CODE ON SINGE REPOS
EX: SVN

STAGES OF GIT:
Git have total 3 stages.

1. WORKING DIRECTORY:
Working Directory is a folder where we write the code.
In Working Directory we can't track the files.

2. STAGING AREA:
here we can track the files.
its next version of your file.


3. REPOSITORY:
it's a folder where we can store tracked file.


BRANCHES:
Branches Is an individual line of development for code.
we create different branches in real-time.
each developer will work on their own branch.
At the end we will combine all branches together in GitHub.
Default branch is Master.
EX: main, feature, release, hotfix ----
Note: without commit we cannot see the branch.
git checkout and git switch both are same but switch is updated command

git branch		: to list the branches
git branch movies	: to create a new branch
git checkout movies	: to switch from one branch to another.
git checkout -b recharge: to create and switch from one branch to another.
git branch -m old new	: to rename a branch
git branch -D movies	: to delete a branch

GIT RESTORE: to restore the deleted files & used to untrack the tracked files.
GIT REFLAG: To restore the deleted branches.
git restore file1 : to get deleted file
git restore --staged file1 : to untrack the tracked file


Note: here every dev works on the local laptop
at the end we want all dev codes to create an application.
so here we use GitHub to combine all dev codes together.

git remote add origin https://github.com/revathisiriki78/paytm.git
git push origin movies

What is meant by git merge, git fetch?
GIT MERGE: it is used to merge the file blw two branches.
git checkout master
git merge movies

GIT REBASE: it is used to merge the file blw two branches.
git rebase recharge
How to integrate one portion of code into another branch? Using git cherry-pick command
MERGE VS REBASE:
merge for public repos, rebase for private 
merge stores history, rebase will not store the entire history
merge will show files, rebase will not show files

PULL REQUEST: MERGING THE BRANCHES IN GITHUB

GIT REVERT: To undo the merging blw two branches.

GIT CLONE: Copy the remote repository to local.
git clone https://github.com/RAHAMSHAIK007/6pmnewpaytm.git

GIT FORK: Copy the repository from one GitHub account to other GitHub account.(should be public repo)

NOTE: to do a fork or clone repo must be public.

MERGE CONFLICTS:
it will rise when we merge 2 different branches with same files.
How to resolve: Manually 
Conflict will occur whenever multiple people working the same file acreoss multiple branches.

CHERRY PICK: it will merge  specific files from one branch to another branch based on commits.
git cherry-pick commit_id

GIT LOGS: used to show the information of files, commits and metadata.

GIT SHOW: To show the files attached to commits.
git show commit_id
GIT DIFF: To show updated content before commit

GIT STASH: to hide the all un-comitted files.

GIT PULL: to get the LATEST CODE from Git Hub to git.
Note: if the content in github and git is same it will not work.

git pull origin master

GIT FETCH: to show the LATEST CODE from Git Hub to git.
git fetch origin master
git fetch 

.gitignore: used to ignore the files which are untracked . here files cant be tracked.
Can we create token on repo: No itâ€™s create on profile only
GIT TOKEN: Token is one time activity only which is used to restrict access at profile level not repo level
README file: whatever we write in description when creating repo it will store in README file.
Git rm: To remove files which are in staging area i.e; tracked files
Git clean: To remove files which are in Working Directory i.e;  untracked files
How do we create local repo: git init localRepoName
git reset: Getback fikles from staging area to working area


GITHUB:
it is a central repo where we place soure code.
we can access github from anywhere with internet.
Purpose of GitHub:to store code we need to create account.

note: it will not accept passwords, it will accept only tokens.
token will be visible only once.
account -- > settings -- > developer settings -- > PAT -- > classic -- > genererate -- > classic 

create a repo
run below command to connect with github:
git remote add origin https://github.com/srinivasnaiduarja/paytm.git
git push origin branch_name 
username:
password: token

===========================================================================================
QUALITY GATES : CCollection of conditions, which are going to apply when we are executing solarqube report. 
If all the conditions are going to pass, then it is going to mark as the passed. Otherwise it is going to mark as failure.

Q).On what basis it is going to marked as PASSED or FAILED?
A).B Based on quality gates, only we can marked as it is passed as failed.

QUALITY PROFILES: It is nothing but a collection of rules which are going to use to execute the solarqube report.
While executing sonarcube report, we are going to use set of rules. Those rules we are going to call as quality profiles.
